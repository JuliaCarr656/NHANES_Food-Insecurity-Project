# NHANES_Food-Insecurity-Project
Using NHANES data from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 cycles, I conducted a multi-cycle cross-sectional analysis to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity and major chronic diseases, and to evaluate how these patterns have shifted compared with earlier cycles from 1999, 2001, and 2003.

Cleaned and merged multi-cycle NHANES datasets (2011–2015), recoded demographic and clinical variables, constructed food insecurity and chronic disease indicators, and generated summary tables, prevalence estimates, and Crude and Adjusted Risk Ratios using R packages including tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, nhanesA, gtsummary, sandwich, and lmtest.

## Purpose
Study how food insecurity is associated with chronic illnesses using NHANES survey data.
