# NHANES_Food-Insecurity-Project
Replicated Hilary K Seligman, Barbara A Laraia, and Margot B Kushel's "Food Insecurity Is Associated with Chronic Disease among Low-Income NHANES Participants" 
study. This replication uses NHANES datasets from **2011, 2013, and 2015** instead of the original 1999, 2001, and 2003 waves. 

Analyzed NHANES data to study links between food insecurity and chronic illness. Cleaned and manipulated datasets, created tables and visualizations, and calculated risk ratios using R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, haven, readr). 

The the original study can be found here: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2806885/

## Purpose
