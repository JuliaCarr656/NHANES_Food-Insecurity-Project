# NHANES_Food-Insecurity-Project
Using NHANES data from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 cycles, I conducted a multi-cycle cross-sectional analysis to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity and major chronic diseases, and to evaluate how these patterns have shifted compared with earlier cycles from 1999, 2001, and 2003.

Cleaned and manipulated datasets, created tables and visualizations, and calculated risk ratios using R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, haven, readr, sandwich, etc).
