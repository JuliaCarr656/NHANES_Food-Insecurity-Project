# NHANES_Food-Insecurity-Project
I used a similar design to Hilary K. Seligman, Barbara A. Laraia, and Margot B. Kushel’s study “Food Insecurity Is Associated with Chronic Disease among Low-Income NHANES Participants,” but conducted a comparison to determine whether there were significant differences between the original rates of food insecurity and chronic illness and more recent data. This replication uses NHANES datasets from 2011, 2013, and 2015 instead of the original 1999, 2001, and 2003 waves. 

Cleaned and manipulated datasets, created tables and visualizations, and calculated risk ratios using R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, haven, readr, sandwich, etc). 

The original study can be found here: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2806885/

## Purpose
Study how food insecurity is associated with chronic illnesses using NHANES survey data.

## Files
- `nhanes.R`: main R script for data analysis
- `.Rproj`: RStudio project file

## How to use
1. Open `nhanes.R` in RStudio.
2. Run the scripts in order.
3. Make sure you install the packages I included in the code.
